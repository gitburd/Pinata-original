"Sometimes even a small shift in route can have a big impact on our mood. Flexibility and openness to new experiences can lead to exciting adventures! If you are brave and explore enough new coping strategies, skills and hobbies you could find a few that work for you."


critical skills: 
Try to change your body temperature. Splash your face with cold water or hold an ice cube to focus your mind on something else. 

Try some intense exercise to help increase oxygen flow to the brain. Sprinting or a good workout at the gym. 

Try taking some deep breaths. Paced breathing can help stop the fight or flight or freeze shallow breathing response. Breath in from your diaphragm for 6 seconds. Hold for 7. Breath out for 8. Pause for 4 seconds and start again.   

Try to release the tension in your body by alternate between tightening and relaxing your muscles. Focus on muscle groups one at a time. You may be holding tension in you face, jaw, neck, shoulders, back, lower back, arms,hands, legs, feet or toes and not realize it.
