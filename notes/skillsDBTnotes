DBT : ACCEPTS 

Activities:
    Most of the things we suggest. 

Contributing:
    Do something kind for another person. 
    Giving service can help you relieve emotional distress in a couple ways. 
    Help cook dinner, mow the neighbor's lawn, or bake cookies for a friend or relative.   
   **Random Kindness 
    **Bake goodies to share 
    **IOU 


 //Comparisons:
    Put your life in perspective. Is there a time when you've faced more difficult challenges than you're facing today? Maybe not—maybe this is the most intense situation and most intense emotion you've ever experienced. (If so, you may need to jump back up to the TIPP section.) If that's the case, is there another person who has suffered more than you? Are you in your safe home, while in another part of the world someone else is searching for food and shelter after a natural disaster? The goal of this exercise is not to add more distress and emotional pain to your current situation. Instead, use this skill to add a different perspective to what you’re experiencing right now.

  Emotions:

  opposite emotion: come up with an activity that is the opposite of each emotion and make a skill for it - user_id 0 so u can put it in the emotion-skills table but it won't get pulled into baseskills 

    You have the power to invoke the opposite emotion of your current distressed feeling. If you are feeling anxious, practice meditation for 15 minutes. If you're feeling depressed, go ahead and Google Image search "adorable puppies". (If you're in need of a real laugh, search "ugly puppies".) Adding a dose of the opposite emotion helps reduce the intensity of the negative emotion.
    
Push away: 
    **timeout:
        set a timer and walk away from the source of distress, it will be waiting for you when the timeout is over and you may be able to face it with a fresh perspective. 
    *schedule reflection: 
        pick a time to process your thoughts and emotions. If you find yourself ruminating and being pulled inward throughout the day know that you have set time aside for that later and redirect outward.       

Thoughts:
    *Say the alphabet backwards, name capitol cities, run through multiplication tables or the period table. 
    **Puzzle 
   
Sensation:
    **armoa
    **bath 
    **listen to music 
    *admire art 
    *cook



IMPROVE stands for Imagery, Meaning, Prayer, Relaxation, One thing in the moment, Vacation, and Encouragement.


Imagery: 
    *visualize success. what is the optimal outcome?
    
Meaning:    
Try to find meaning in painful situations. Can this experience guide you to becoming more empathetic, patient or to build new relationships? Can anything positive come from your present suffering?

//
PRAYER
Prayer can come in any form that works for you. The prayer can be to any higher power, including God or the universe. Surrender your problems and ask to tolerate the situation a little longer.
//

RELAXATION
    for anxiety : 
    deep breathing, yoga, a hot bath, and a relaxing walk.


ONE THING IN THE MOMENT
for overwhelming/helpless/stressed out  
Stay in the moment by letting go of the past and future. Adding old issues to the situation, or future tripping about potential consequences of the situation, will not be helpful in solving the problem. Find one thing to do and focus your entire self to that task. A one-track mind helps emotions feel less overwhelming.

VACATION
On the ideal vacation, you’re able to take a break from all your stressors and return home ready to take on the challenges you left behind. Unfortunately, most of us aren't able to take a real vacation during a moment of crisis. Instead, you can take a vacation in your mind. Imagine yourself somewhere else, like taking an evening stroll around the lake or driving on the Pacific Coast Highway. Stay on your "vacation" as long as necessary, and revisit as often as needed. Hopefully, you'll "return" better able to tolerate your circumstances.

ENCOURAGEMENT
    *positive affirmation : make one for each emotion group 
    *inspirational quotes: make one for each emotion group 


Encouragement doesn't have to come from an external source to be effective. Give yourself encouragement by repeating phrases that are meaningful to you, such as “I got this”, “I can improve this moment”, or "¡sí se puede!". Say it loud, say it proud! You’ll be amazed at your ability to motivate yourself to make it through a challenging time.



*pros and cons list

!!self soothing!!
SIGHT
     Count how many places you can see a certain color in the room, or focus on an object’s texture. You can also pull out your phone and scroll through some of your favorite photos.

HEARING
    Listen to sounds—any sounds. Can you hear birds chirping or the sound of traffic outside? Turn the volume up on your favorite song and just listen. If you prefer soothing sounds, there are many apps you can install on your phone to play on the go.
TOUCH
    Embrace your sense of touch by noticing how a pen feels in your hand, running your fingers through your hair, or using a fidget toy. When appropriate, you can wrap yourself in a blanket or take a warm bath.

SMELL
Whether it’s good or bad, focus on whatever scent is in the air. Can you identify the smell, or break it down into its components? For easy access to a scent you find calming, put a few drops of your favorite essential oil onto a cotton ball and keep it with you in a plastic bag.

MOVEMENT
While you technically only have five senses, DBT introduces a sixth sense of movement. Your emotional state can be altered by your body’s movements, so take a walk around the block or dance to your favorite song!
