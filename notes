or i could add an Auth0_user_id to users table : 

when they log in - get their Auth0_user_id - set user id based on that. and let everything else be. 
but what puts them in the user's table? 

user logs in 
    get their Auth0_user_id -
        select * from users where Auth0_user_id = Auth0_user_id

        if res.lenght=0 
        insert into users : 
        Auth0_user_id, email

        select * from users where Auth0_user_id = Auth0_user_id
          
        this.setState({user_id : res[0].user_id})
